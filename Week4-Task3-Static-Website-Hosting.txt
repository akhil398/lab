TASK 3 - STATIC WEBSITE HOSTING IN S3
======================================
Goal: Create an S3 bucket, upload index.html and error.html, enable static website hosting, set public read access via ACL at both bucket and object levels, and access the website using the S3 website endpoint URL.


PRE-REQUISITE: PREPARE YOUR HTML FILES
--------------------------------------
Before starting, create two simple HTML files on your computer.

Open Notepad (Windows) or any text editor and create:

FILE 1 -- save as:   index.html
Paste this content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My S3 Website</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Static Website on S3</h1>
<p>This site is hosted on Amazon S3.</p>
</body>
</html>

FILE 2 -- save as:   error.html
Paste this content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Error - Page Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
<p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
</body>
</html>

Save both files somewhere easy to find (e.g. your Desktop).

--------------------------------------
STEP 7: ACCESS AND VERIFY THE STATIC WEBSITE
--------------------------------------

TEST THE HOMEPAGE:

1. Go to the "Properties" tab of your bucket

2. Scroll down to "Static website hosting"

3. Click the link under "Bucket website endpoint"
   OR copy the URL and paste it in a browser

   URL format:
   http://my-static-site-bucket-123.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

4. A new browser tab will open
   You should see the contents of   index.html   -- your welcome page

   This confirms the static website is working.

TEST THE ERROR PAGE:

5. In the same browser, add a non-existent path to the URL:
   http://my-static-site-bucket-123.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/invalid.html

6. Press Enter

7. You should see the contents of   error.html   -- your error page

   This confirms the error page routing is working correctly.


======================================
TASK 3 COMPLETE
An S3 static website is live. index.html loads on the main URL and error.html appears for any invalid/missing page paths. Public access is granted via ACL at both bucket and object levels.
