TASK 1 - CREATE AN S3 BUCKET, UPLOAD AN OBJECT, AND ENABLE PUBLIC ACCESS
=========================================================================
Goal: Create an S3 bucket, enable ACLs, upload a file, and make it publicly accessible so anyone can open it via a URL in the browser.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: OPEN THE S3 SERVICE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top-right corner: Make sure your region is set to   US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1

5. Click the orange "Create bucket" button


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: CONFIGURE BUCKET NAME AND REGION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the "Create bucket" page:

1. Under "General configuration":
   - AWS Region: select   US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1
   - Bucket name: type   my-public-bucket-123
     NOTE: Bucket names must be globally unique. If this name is taken,
     try adding your name or a number, e.g.   my-public-bucket-archana-2026

2. Under "Object Ownership":
   - By default it shows "ACLs disabled (recommended)"
   - Click to select   "ACLs enabled"

   - A warning message will appear -- that is fine, continue


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: DISABLE BLOCK PUBLIC ACCESS

Still on the "Create bucket" page, scroll down to find:

"Block Public Access settings for this bucket"

1. Uncheck the box that says   "Block all public access"

2. All four sub-checkboxes will also become unchecked automatically -- leave them all unchecked

3. A yellow warning box will appear at the bottom of that section saying:
   "Turning off block all public access might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public"

4. Check the box that says:
   "I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public"


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: COMPLETE BUCKET CREATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page

2. Leave all other settings as their defaults

3. Click the orange "Create bucket" button at the bottom

4. You will be taken back to the S3 Buckets list

5. Confirm you can see your new bucket   my-public-bucket-123   in the list


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: ENABLE PUBLIC READ ACCESS AT BUCKET LEVEL (ACL)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click on the bucket name   my-public-bucket-123   to open it

2. At the top of the bucket page, click the "Permissions" tab

3. Scroll down until you see the section "Access Control List (ACL)"

4. Click the "Edit" button on the right side of that section

5. On the "Edit access control list (ACL)" page:
   - Find the row labeled   "Everyone (public access)"
   - Under the "Objects" column for that row, check the box for   "Read"
   - A warning pop-up will appear at the bottom of the page

6. Check the box that says:
   "I understand the effects of these changes on my objects and buckets."

7. Click the orange "Save changes" button

8. You will be taken back to the Permissions tab
   Confirm that the ACL section now shows "Read" for Everyone (public access)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 6: UPLOAD A FILE TO THE BUCKET
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click the "Objects" tab at the top of the bucket page

2. Click the orange "Upload" button

3. On the Upload page, click "Add files"

4. A file picker will open on your computer
   - Navigate to and select any file you want to upload
   - For example: an image file like   photo.jpg   or a PDF

5. The file will appear in the "Files and folders" section on the page

6. Leave all other settings as default

7. Click the orange "Upload" button at the bottom

8. Wait for the upload to complete
   - You will see a green banner: "Upload succeeded"
   - The status column will show "Succeeded" for your file

9. Click "Close" to go back to the Objects list


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 7: ENABLE PUBLIC READ ACCESS AT OBJECT LEVEL (ACL)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Objects tab, click on the name of the file you just uploaded

2. You will be taken to the object detail page

3. Click the "Permissions" tab on the object page

4. Scroll down to "Access Control List (ACL)"

5. Click the "Edit" button

6. On the "Edit access control list" page:
   - Find the row labeled   "Everyone (public access)"
   - Under the "Objects" column, check the box for   "Read"

7. Check the box at the bottom:
   "I understand the effects of these changes on this object."

8. Click the orange "Save changes" button


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 8: VERIFY PUBLIC ACCESS - TEST THE OBJECT URL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go back to the object detail page
   (click the object name from the Objects tab)

2. On the object detail page, scroll down to find "Object URL"
   It will look like:
   https://my-public-bucket-123.s3.amazonaws.com/yourfilename.jpg

3. Click on the URL or copy it

4. Open a new browser tab in Incognito / Private mode
   (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome, Ctrl+Shift+P in Firefox)

5. Paste the URL in the incognito browser and press Enter

6. The file should open / download successfully WITHOUT requiring any login

   If the file loads -- public access is working correctly.
   If you get an "Access Denied" error -- go back and check Steps 5 and 7.
