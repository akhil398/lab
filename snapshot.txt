3. Create a snapshot of the attached EBS volume and use it to create and attach
a new volume to an EC2 instance in another AWS region.
Attaching Volumes across regions of EC2 using the snapshot
To create a snapshot of an EBS volume and attach it to an instance in another region in AWS, you'll need
to follow these steps:
Step 1. Create a Snapshot:
 a. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
 b. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
 c. Click on "Volumes" in the left-hand navigation pane.
 d. Select the EBS volume you want to create a snapshot of.
 e. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu above the volume list and select "Create Snapshot."
 f. Provide a name and description for the snapshot.
 g. Click on the "Create Snapshot" button to initiate the snapshot creation process.
Step 2. Copy the Snapshot to Another Region:
 a. Once the snapshot is created, go to the "Snapshots" section in the EC2 Dashboard.
 b. Select the snapshot you just created.
 c. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu above the snapshot list and select "Copy Snapshot."
 d. Choose the destination region where you want to copy the snapshot.
 e. Click on the "Copy Snapshot" button to initiate the copy process. This may take some time depending
on the size of the snapshot and the network speed.
Step 3. Monitor the Snapshot Copy Progress:
 a. You can monitor the progress of the snapshot copy by navigating to the "Snapshots" section in the
EC2 Dashboard of the source region.
 b. Look for the snapshot you copied and check its status. It will change from "pending" to "completed"
once the copy process is finished.
Step 4. Switch to the Destination Region:
a. Use the region selector in the top-right corner of the AWS Management Console to switch to the
destination region where you copied the snapshot.
Step 5. Create a Volume from the Snapshot:
 a. In the EC2 Dashboard of the destination region, go to the "Snapshots" section.
 b. Find the snapshot you copied from the source region.
 c. Click on the snapshot, then click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Create Volume."
 d. Configure the volume settings, such as volume type, size, and availability zone.
 e. Click on the "Create Volume" button to create the volume from the snapshot.
Step 6. Create the ec2 instance & Attach the Volume to an Instance:
 a. Once the volume is created, navigate to the "Volumes" section in the EC2 Dashboard.
 b. Find the newly created volume and select it.
 c. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Attach Volume."
 D the EC2 instance to which you want to attach the volume and specify the device name.
 e. Click on the "Attach" button to attach the volume to the instance.
We have created a snapshot of an EBS volume, copied it to another region, created a volume from the
snapshot, and attached it to an instance in the destination region.
